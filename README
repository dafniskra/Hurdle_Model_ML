# 1 - Modèle Hurdle paramétrique et Modèle Hurdle apprentissage statistique pour estimer la fréquence des accidents

Here you find the code to the article "Parametric Hurdle Model and Statistical Learning Hurdle Model for estimating accident frequency".  Some of the code are in R and some in Python. 

To compare our Hurdle model with machine learning we have done 4 other models. 

### parametric model 
-GLM of fish 
-Parametric Hurdle

### models that come from the literature :
- decision tree
- Poisson boosting tree model

For the tree and boosting model, the codes come from the article: "Case Study: French Motor Third-Party Liability Claims" from A. Noll, R. Salzmann and M.V. Wüthrich, available from https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3164764.

# 2 - Code

For the data, we use FreMTPL2freq. We have 85% for training and 15% for testing.
The code are in R and Python.
